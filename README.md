# GSP'17 Poster on Disc-GLasso

This repository generates my poster presented at Graph Signal Processing Workshop held at Carnegie Mellon University, May 31 – June 2, 2017. 

The poster is titled "Disc-GLasso: Discriminative Graph Learning with Sparsity Regularization" and is made based on our publication at ICASSP 2017 in New Orleans. 

The code will be available on this page soon.
